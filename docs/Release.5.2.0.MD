# Check Your Long Term Flood Risk Services (cyltfr-admin)

# v5.2.0

## Release date 26 March 2025

### Allow users to see other users holding comments.

Previously only approvers were able to see all comments on the system. This caused problems
when staff changed, as new users were not able to see comments from old users. Users can now
view and edit all comments on the system.

### Add flood risk field on landing page

A `flood risk type` column has been added to the landing page, so that 'Rivers and Sea' and 
'Surface water' comments can be distinguished without having to view the comment.

### Increase map size when in approval view

The map displayed in the approval view has been increased in size.

### Remove full stops and quotation marks on holding comment free text

In the example text for holding comments, quote marks and full stops were originally included. As
users copied and pasted these into the holding comment box, this was ending up with extranious 
full stops in email address links. These have now been removed.

### Update gov.uk package to v5.8.0

Chore. Keeping packages up to date.
